# Sculptura-T1

![DSCI0023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ce202cc-6661-4a3f-aa82-90043cb3f4e2)

This is the Sculptura T1, a machine with a vision for the future:

_Uniting many modern machines into a single unit._

Eventhough it is meant to be a multitask machine for the moment it focuses on (multimaterial) 3D printing with it's main focus on customisability while maintaining a powerful and next-gen basis and including up to 4 toolheads. In the future it will include things such as toolheads and heatbeds for additional purpouses(eg. 3D printing, SAFE laser ingraving, pen plotting, and if any other use case it is just needed to design the toolhead)


In the current version (V1), it's features are:
- Toolchanger capabilites with up to 5 hotends/tools.
- Klipper fimrware, fast and Open Source.
- A Manta M4P mainboard.
- Fast and reliable coreXY kinematics.
- An ultralight hotend Setup based upon Sherpa Mini.
- It is fully enclosed, ready for demanding materials.
- A 220x220x230 build volume.
- Linear rails on X and Y axis for high rigidity
- A 3.5 Inch, color touchscreen.
- Full WiFi connectivity via Mainsail.
- A full RGB enclosure light.
- A 12V heater bed.

This Project is possible thanks to the Open Source community!
So I would like to thank all of the project that created all the amazing projects that made this project possible and in particular: 
- Voron Design (Trident, V2.4R2)
- Prusa Research (Prusa XL,Prusa MK2(My first 3D printer)
- E3D (Toolchanger,V6 hotend)
- BigTreeTech (Manta M4P,TFT35 touchscreen)
