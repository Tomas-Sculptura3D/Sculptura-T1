# Sculptura-T1

This is the Sculptura T1, my vision of the next generation 3D printers,inspired multiple other 3D printers, this printer has it's main focus on customisability while maintaining a powerful and next-gen basis and with the possibility of including up to 4 toolheads. For the moment it's limited to 3D printer hotends toolheads but the goal is to make a very solid base machine that can be used/converted to many purpouses (eg. 3D printing, SAFE laser ingraving, pen plotting, and if any other use case it is just needed to design the toolhead)

It features:
- Toolchanger capabilites with up to 5 hotends/tools.
- Klipper fimrware, fast and Open Source.
- A Manta M4P mainboard.
- Fast and reliable coreXY kinematics.
- An ultralight hotend Setup based upon Sherpa Mini.
- It is fully enclosed, ready for demanding materials.
- A 220x220x230 build volume.
- Linear rails on X and Y axis for high rigidity
- A 3.5 Inch, color touchscreen.
- Full WiFi connectivity via Mainsail.
- A full RGB enclosure light.
- A 12V heater bed.

This Project is possible thanks to the Open Source community!
