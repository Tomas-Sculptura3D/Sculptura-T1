# Sculptura-T1

![DSCI0023](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ce202cc-6661-4a3f-aa82-90043cb3f4e2)

**This is the Sculptura T1, a unique machine with a vision for the future:**

**_"Uniting many modern machines into a single unit"_**

Even Though it is meant to be a multitask machine for the moment it focuses on (multimaterial) 3D printing, customizability while maintaining a powerful and next-gen basis and including up to 4 toolheads for future iterations. In the next versions it will include things such as toolheads and heatbeds for additional purposes(eg. 3D printing, SAFE laser engraving, pen plotting, and in any other use case it is just needed to design the toolhead not the whole machine)


In the current version (V1), it's features are:
- Toolchanger capabilites with up to 4 hotends/tools.
- Klipper firmware, fast, modern and Open Source.
- A Manta M4P mainboard.
- Fast, precise and reliable coreXY kinematics.
- An ultralight hotend Setup based upon Sherpa Mini.
- An extensive hotend ecosystem based on the E3D V6
- It is fully enclosed, ready for demanding materials.
- A 220x220x230 build volume.
- Linear rails on X and Y axis for high rigidity
- A 3.5" color touchscreen.
- WiFi connectivity via Mainsail and stylish UI.
- A full RGB enclosure light.
- A 12V heater bed with magnetic PEI steel sheets

This Project is possible thanks to the Open Source community!
So I would like to thank all of the people that contribute to it and in particular: 
- Voron Design (Trident, V2.4R2)
- Prusa Research (Prusa XL,Prusa MK2(My first 3D printer)
- E3D (Toolchanger,V6 hotend)
- BigTreeTech (Manta M4P,TFT35 touchscreen)
