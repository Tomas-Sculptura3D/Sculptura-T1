This is the Sculptura T1, my vision of the next generation 3D printers, It features:
- Toolchanger capabilites with up to 5 hotends/tools.
- Klipper fimrware, fast and Open Source.
- Fast and reliable coreXY kinematics.
- An ultralight hotend Setup based upon Sherpa Mini.
- It is fully enclosed, ready for demanding materials.
- A 220x220x230 build volume.
- Linear rails on X and Y axis for high rigidity
- A 3.5 Inch, color touchscreen.
- Full WiFi connectivity via Mainsail.
- A full RGB enclosure light.
- A 12V heater bed.

This Project is possible thanks to the Open Source community!
